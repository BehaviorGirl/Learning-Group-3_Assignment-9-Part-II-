Learning Group 3_Assignment #9 (Part II)

This is a class collaboration project is a part of our Assignment #9 for EDRM 718 at the UofSC. Part I of the assignment was
completed and submitted individually. Part II of the assignment is a practice collaboration project. 
Our research question is: For women who suffered childhood physical abuse, is there a difference in the average PTSD scores of women
who also suffered childhood secual abuse and those who did not suffer childhood sexual abuse, after accounting for the severity of
the childhood physical abuse?

Only learning group members will work within the project, but anyone is welcome to look.
